# Chapter 4

Balancing two grocery bags in one arm and her keys in the other, Amber shoved her way through the front door of their cottage. She sat the bags down on the counter and hung her coat and keys on the hallway hook.

“Hello,” she called out. “I’m home, sorry I’m so late.“ Due to traffic, the drive from Providence to New Port had taken over two hours, plus she had stopped at the grocery store to get a few things for their trip in the morning. She checked the clock. Almost eight, Joseph must be starving.

Butch, a German shepherd mix trotted into the kitchen. He nudged her arm and waited for her usual greeting. Amber bent down and kissed him on top of the head. “Have you behaved yourself today Butch?”

The dog huffed, as if bored with her petty demands of proper conduct, and then turned away, snout up, with obvious dismissal.

“Hey mom,” Joseph yelled from the hallway. He bounced into the kitchen a second later, like a plow truck fueled by pure adrenaline. At fifteen, Joseph had the body of a man with the energy of a two year old, awkward and lanky, as if his limbs hadn’t adjusted to his ever growing height.

“What have you been up to?” She yanked off her boots, dropped them by the door, mulled over the best way to break the news to her son.

He grinned waging his eyebrows. His dark eyes, so like his father’s, twinkled with mischief. “Ask me why I’m so awesome?”

Amber groaned yet, unable to resist her son’s antics, she played along. “Okay….why are you so awesome?”

He yanked up his T-shirt with one hand, showing off his midriff.”Look at this six-pack.”

The muscle tone was there, barely. “Oh, gosh darn it Joseph…put your shirt down, you are going to traumatize your mother for life.”

He laughed, letting the shirt drop. His confidence at fifteen boggled her mind. Something else he had inherited from his father.

“What’s for dinner?” Joseph hovered over her, crowding the kitchen.

“Did you find the subs I left you?”

“Yeah”, he grinned. “Thanks. I had those for a snack.”

Amber thought of food in the fridge that needed to be used. “How about meat loaf?”

“That takes too long.” The deep timbre of his changing voice contradicted the whine of adolescence.” “How about Chicken Alfredo?”

“The chicken is frozen. Do you want a BLT?” She worked around him, organizing food on the counter. Not an easy task considering he was a half foot taller than her and twice as solid.

And hungry.

“Come on, mom. I’m starving, BLT’s are, like, hello, a lunch. I need real food, Cheese Pasta. Chicken, I’m wasting away here.”

“Ravaging locust eat less than you do. I swear.” She searched the fridge for Parmesan cheese and cream. “I don’t know where you put it all.

“I’m a growing boy,” said with a grin. ”That’s why you should make me Chicken Alfredo.”

“Okay” Amber conceded, putting four chicken breasts in the microwave to defrost.

“Thank you Mama.”

“Mama” was his latest terms of endearment, when she caved on something he wanted. She tended to give in a lot. How could she not? He was, it seemed, her only weakness. She had done the unthinkable to keep him close and she would do so much more if necessary.

“Where’s your grandmother?” Amber chopped garlic for the Alfredo and set it aside. She then pulled frozen basil from the freezer, along with cream, wine, cheese and butter from the fridge to start the sauce.

Joseph leaned his head out of the snack cupboard, his hand in a bag of Oreo’s “huh?”

“Your grandmother?” she repeated. “Where is she?”

“Playing chess with Diane next door.” Joseph mumbled around a mouthful of cookies.

“We need to talk,” Amber said calmly even though her insides heaved in protest.

Joseph stilled, eyeing her warily. “You’re using your serious voice.”

Amber waited until she had added the wine to the pan and then set the sauce to simmer. She turned to face her son, searching for the right words, and decided on blunt honesty. “I called your father today.”

His reaction was physical, a slight shifting of skin and unnatural narrowing of the skull, hardly visible and gone in a second.

The changes were so minute a regular person might not have even noticed. But she wasn’t a regular person. She was his mother.

She knew her child.

Just like she knew the shifts caused him considerable pain although he tried to hide that fact. They had begun three weeks ago each one more pronounced than the last.

He could die.

Her stomach clenched with the sickening reminder of those words, and she reached out to her son. The instant her hand touched his arm, goose bumps formed on her skin as if kissed by lightening.

An unusual scent filled the air, like rain on hot sand, elements colliding. Nature manipulated. The scent was sharp and distinct and forever ingrained in her memory. It took her back to the only time she had witnessed Jeremy become a wolf.

Leaves and pine needles crunched under her sneakers, crisp from rain starting to freeze. Evening clouds obscured a waning moon, masking their journey with darkness. Jeremy held her firm, dragging by one arm down a cleared path as Cody and Joe and five other guards walked ahead and behind, blocking all chances of escapes.

They were far from the house now, deep in the forest, surrounded by tree’s going dormant for winter, with leaves shaded red, orange and yellow. Happy colors muddied by night that didn’t soothe her racing heart.

Amber shivered, more from disbelief than fear.”Where are you taking me? Why are you doing this? I don’t understand.”

Jeremy pulled her farther into the woods, his grip unyielding, bruising her pride more than anything else. He spoke for the first time since their argument.

“There is much about my world you don’t know or understand.”

She yanked her arm, numb to the wrenching pain as she fought for freedom. He always spoke in vague references alluding to some great secret, as if she were a child too naïve to be kept here against her will.

“Yes I can” and his voice held complete conviction to his ability to do just that.

“And I will…as long as you carry my child. If you chose to leave after the birth I will not interfere, but if you do leave….the child will remain with me.

Amber felt a tear slide down her cheek, disgusted by her own weakness but unable to stop the rush of emotions. She wrapped her free arm around the small bulge of her belly. Protective…Instinctive…Possessive.

Hers

He let her go suddenly, almost as if he felt her intentions. She stumbled forward into a glen sheltered from the rain by an arching oak tree.

Jeremy walked before her, his blond hair plastered against his face and neck, streaks of rain trailing down his rigid jaw. There was no warmth in his expression, no emotion other than harsh resolve. The passion they had once shared as lovers had turned to anger months ago. Once he’d become aware of their child everything had changed.

He changed.

His eyes met hers, black as death in the distance, holding her rooted to that spot in the glen, even though every instinct in her being screamed, Run!

“Now you will know why I keep you guarded Amber. Why you must forget your old life.”

He methodically began to remove his clothing until he stood before her naked. The lure to watch was potent. Shadows danced across the hard planes of his chest and stomach, like a gypsy’s dance teasing a potential lover.

Even in anger, she was drawn to him.

Undaunted by their audience he stood before her confident and glorious. His wide shoulders squared in her inspection, his thick legs braced a foot apart, his stance unconsciously dominant, innately beautiful.

His sex hung dark and heavy against his thigh.

Cody and two other guards surrounded him, like warriors falling in behind their leader. Jeremy opened his arms wide, tilted his somber face to the sky and the forest wept.
