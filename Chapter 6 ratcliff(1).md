# Chapter 7
A circle of tall pine trees hid the small clinic from outside eyes. The building was all one level, half built into the ground, a fairly modern design of cement walls and metal roofing painted brown and green to blend with its surroundings.

Amber followed Joseph and Jeremy along a dark path that led to the only visible entrance. Her son hovered close to his father, eager to please and not acting the least bit unhealthy.

She glared at Jeremy’s back, fuming at her own stupidity, beginning to realize Joseph had never been in any real danger and that Jeremy had taken advantage of her ignorance. He’s been too darn happy in the truck at the first indication of – whatever the heck it was. *Power*, they called it.

Jeremy opened the door to the clinic, a smile – an actual smile – on his face as he laughed at something Joseph had said.

Her breath clogged in her throat as she watched the budding relationship grow stronger with each passing moment. Her son looked happy, more than happy; accepted, wanted.

Her shoulders slumped. Jeremy deserved to know his son, and Joseph needed his father. She no longer had the right to deny them that relationship.

As if she ever had…

“Mom, come on.” Joseph held the solid metal door, waiting for her.

And suddenly a small weight of sadness lifted and she quickened her step.

Jeremy would never be able to take away the time she had with their son. No matter what the future held, Joseph would always know how much she loved him.

“Hold on,” she said. “I’m coming.”

Akasha stood in a large open space reserved for incoming emergencies. She looked just as fair and lovely as Amber had remembered, with her hands crossed in front of her chest, watching Joseph approach with tear-filled eyes.

“Hello, Joseph. My goodness, you’re tall. And handsome. I’m your Aunt Akasha. It seems I’ve waited forever to meet you.”

Joseph held up his hand in a quick move, uncomfortable with the personal greeting. “Hi.”

Akasha stepped back, obviously sensing his unease. She turned to Amber and her expression turned colder than Fiddlehead Lake in February. “Thank you for bringing him home. If you don’t mind, I’d like to ask you a few questions. Then I will examine him in private.”

Icy, professional, and yet Joseph’s alarmed expression gentled her voice. “Just a quick check of your vitals.” She told him. “It won’t take long. Your mom can come, too, if you’d be more comfortable.”

He straightened under the insinuation of still needing his mother. “Nah. I’m good.”

“Joseph has never been to a hospital before.” Amber found it necessary to explain. “He’s never been sick, until recently.”

“I’m not sick, mom!”

Amber waved away the interruption. “You know what I mean.”

Akasha frowned, tilting her head to one side, assessing. “Where did you give birth?”

“At home. With midwives.” Amber tried to ignore Jeremy’s silent glare. “I was afraid he’d be different. I didn’t want him to be taken if he was.”

Akasha nodded, not denying the possibility. “Was the birth normal?”

“I believe so. But it was long.”

“How long?” Jeremy asked.

“Twenty-five hours. He was ten pounds six ounces.” Amber said proudly. “And perfect.”

Akasha’s posture softened at the last comment, although her voice remained reserved. “What did you feed him as an infant?”

“I nursed. My mother tried to give him a bottle once just to supplement his feeding but he wouldn’t take it. He was hungry all the time. He fed more than he slept. You should have seen me, I was huge.” Amber dropped her hands, realizing with some embarrassment she’d been demonstrating how big her chest had gotten.

Joseph groaned. “Way more info than I needed to hear.” Jeremy had gone rigid, the small muscle on the side of his cheek flexed and relaxed, then flexed again.

Akasha tactfully changed the subject. “And after? What’s his diet been like?”

Amber let out a soft laugh. “Pretty much everything I gave him and then some. He never seems to gain weight. I even supplement his meals with protein shakes.” Akasha gave Joseph a brief smile .

“He looks good,” Akasha admitted. “So whatever you’ve done has worked well for him. Has he had any immunizations?”

“No.” Amber shook her head. “Should he have? I was just afraid to expose him.”

Akasha shrugged. “They’re unnecessary but wouldn’t have harmed him. I ask only because a few cause lethargic symptoms until both immune systems adjust. It might have explained certain behaviors. You must have homeschooled him, then?” 

“Not always. I worked in the public school system when he was younger. I forged his health records. If you look for them,” she warned to discourage an investigation, “they are inaccurate.”

“So you’ve become quietly resourceful, haven’t you?” Jeremy commented dryly.

Amber sent him a too sweet smile. “I’ve always been resourceful. Now I’m just paranoid.”

“Any unexplained broken bones?” Akasha continued her questioning without pause. “High fevers? Problems sleeping?”

Again Amber shook her head. “He’s always been healthy up until three weeks ago,” she hesitated, still finding it odd to speak openly, “...when the change began.”

Akasha’s eyes darted to Jeremy. “Thank you, that’s all I need for now. Joseph can answer the rest of my questions.” She waved him over. “Are you ready, my handsome nephew?”

“I guess so.” Joseph didn’t look exactly thrilled to be led down the strange corridor by an unfamiliar aunt.

As he turned away, Amber forced a reassuring smile. Letting him walk down the hallway without her was beyond difficult. It was, in a sense, the first step toward letting him go. Akasha’s frosty reception was in defense of her brother and she would never harm her nephew. Joseph was almost sixteen.

Unfortunately, the heart wasn’t guided by reason.

Adding to her unease was Jeremy’s looming presence – and the simple fact that they were now alone. She was fairly certain her punishment was about to begin.
