# Chapter 3

Joe barged into the study, his breathing uneven. His raven-dark brow narrowed over fierce blue eyes as he glared at Jeremy with obvious annoyance. A tattoo of a Celtic cross covered his bare cranium. He always kept his head shaved bald flaunting his Irish mothers’ symbol. The personal insult the Christian emblem represented to the Guardians was just an added perk.

He marched over and brandished a cellphone. “If you will not carry your doggone phone,” he took in a large gulp of air, his nostrils flaring. “I’m wondering why you bother having it.” 

Jeremy accepted the phone and placed it on the mantel. “What’s wrong?”

“You had a call on the main line.” Joe crossed his thick arms, his chin raised. He wasn’t an overly tall man, barely six feet, but what he lacked in height was more than compensated for by width. He was vicious in battle, fearless – his inability to shift irrelevant.

“And?"

“It was *that woman*.”

A fist wrapped around Jeremy’s gut and squeezed. There was only one person Joe called *that woman*. “Excuse me?”

“You heard me.”

Akasha inhaled sharply, edging to the side of the sofa. “Amber. Are you sure?”

Joe shot her a disgusted glare before handing Jeremy a piece of paper with a number. "She gave you an hour to call.” He checked his watch. “And I wasted fifteen minutes trying to find you.” The censure in his voice eased into respect. “She wanted me to tell you that it concerns your son.”

“A son?”  Akasha whispered.

Jeremy stared down at the number in his hand. All thoughts of the Guardians, Cymre, his people, the gathering -- gone. Until that moment, he hadn’t known the sex of his child. He turned his back to the room, facing the fireplace, not wanting his weakness observed.

“Watch yourself,” Joe warned. “The woman is more cunning than a mother fox.”

Jeremy hadn’t needed the warning. He’d underestimated Amber once on the night she ran, four months pregnant, and he still hadn’t been able to track her. Then she erased herself completely.

Everything except her father’s grave. Desecration, it seemed, was where her line of betrayal ended.

Joe cleared his throat, giving his form of consolation. “You almost had her in California.”

“Four years ago,” Jeremy snapped, unappeased, “and she cleared out just before we got there.”

Five times he’d almost caught Amber, but not once had he gotten a glimpse of the child. Every time she had eluded him; it was as if an unseen force had warned her. A ridiculous notion, he knew... because Amber was only human.

Jeremy felt a delicate hand on his shoulder and he shrugged it off. “I want to be alone for this call.”

Akasha’s footsteps retreated to Joe’s side of the room. “We will wait for you outside.”

“Use the house phone,” Joe added. “I’ll be tracing the call.”

Amber sat on a granite bench as moisture seeped into her jeans. She almost stood, but slumped back instead, figuring a wet butt was the least of her worries.

The waiting was brutal. She checked her watch for the hundredth time, almost convinced Jeremy wasn’t going to call, when the phone lit up its unfamiliar ring causing every muscle in her body to tense.

With shaking hands, she brought the receiver to her ear. “Hello.”

“Amber?” Deep and calm, but with an underlying edge of controlled anger.

She had rehearsed this conversation a thousand times, but the reality of hearing his voice erased all rational thought. “I’m sorry,” She whispered. ”This was a bad idea.”

“Don’t you dare hang up on me, or-–“

“Or *what*?” The hairs on the back of her head stood on end. His arrogant tone flooded her with unpleasant memories. “You’ll hunt me down like a rabid animal? Been there, done that.”

“You’ve held on to your anger well, Amber. Yet I’m the one who has never seen my son's face.”

She swallowed hard, clutching the phone with both hands. “You gave me no other choice.”

“Not true.” His toned dropped dangerously low. “You could have stayed.”

“As a prisoner.”

“No,” he growled. “As my wife.”

“Is there a difference?”

Silence filled their tenuous connection, thick and vile, poisoned by mutual betrayals.

A muffled sound followed as if Jeremy had pressed the receiver into something soft to hide his reaction.

“I’m sorry,” she whispered. "I didn’t call you for this.”

“What’s my son’s name?”

Her breath caught in her throat. Such a simple question. “Joseph.”

“Joseph,” he repeated in a low tone. “A good name. Is he well?"

“He’s beautiful,” she said with a heavy heart. “He's the reason I called. I need to ask you something.”

A slight hesitation. “What’s wrong?”

“Joseph has been...” Amber chose her words carefully, “...acting odd lately. And not the normal teenager kind of odd.”

“What are you suggesting?”

“I’m suggesting he may have inherited more of his father than I had hoped.”

A long pause. “Are you talking from a cell line?”

She understood his concerns. “I can call you from another line?”

“No!” he snapped, and then softened. “You need to bring my son home. If what you're suggesting is true, it’s a dangerous time for him.”

She felt dizzy. Nausea and panic edged to the surface. “How dangerous?”

“He could die.”

Her heart clenched with the worst kind of pain; it was what she feared most. “What can I do?”

“Come home.” Jeremy coaxed. "I can help him... before it’s too late.”

An overwhelming apprehension drove her to make an unplanned offer. “We can meet somewhere?”

He didn’t answer immediately, the predator having sensed her fear and using it to sway her decision. “He needs to be around his own kind now. Are you willing to risk his life because of your hatred for me?”

“You’re so clueless,” she snapped, letting all her painful memories fill those few words.

“Then enlighten me.”

“It’s irrelevant now.” She closed her eyes, weighing her options. Her son’s welfare, as always, influenced her decisions. However, Amber had a distinct advantage over the last time she had been in Ratcliff Village. She was not the same naïve woman that Jeremy had once known. She was older now, wiser, and had learned how to defend herself and those she loved. Quite well, in fact.

“Is the lake house still available?”

“It can be.”

“I need a few days to clear things up.”

“You must come now,” he said, his voice firm. “A few days may be too late.”

“I’ll be there tomorrow,” she conceded, not liking the fact that it revealed a hint to her proximity. She had others to protect. “We’ll be there in the evening...” She calculated the travel time in her head and added six hours. “Probably around eight. I’ll call you on the phone when we reach Montana.”

“Hold on...” his voice trailed off and then returned. “Let me give you my cell number.”

An unexpected laugh erupted from her, or more like an involuntary release of pent-up nerves. 

“You find that amusing?”

“Well, maybe a little...” she admitted.

“The world’s changing. Sometimes we are forced to change with it.”

“Yes,” she agreed. “Sometimes we are.”

The easy banter opened a door of mutual awareness.

“If I asked you where my son is now, would you tell me?”

She sighed. “We are coming to you. Let that be enough.”

“And if something happens to you, how would he know where to find me?”

Amber wasn’t offended by the question because she had prepared for that possibility.

“Your son has always known where you are.”

There was a muffled sound, as if again Jeremy pulled the phone away to hide his reaction. When the lined cleared he spoke low, his voice strained. “How much does he know about me?”

“Everything that I know.” She answered honestly, and then ended the call before Jeremy asked more questions she wasn’t prepared to answer.

“Then he knows nothing!” he mumbled fiercely.

Jeremy shoved the phone away and ran his hands over his face. He hadn’t been prepared for the sound of her voice. He wanted to throttle her, to lock her in a room and destroy the stupid key.

He wanted...

Jeremy stopped abruptly, scraping back his chair and making his way down to the media room. Akasha hurried after him, her face expectant. He held up his hand, a silent message, unhappy, but compliant.

Joe sat at his desk, focused on his equipment, his shiny head bobbing to the pop-rock sounds of Stevie Nicks' *'Stop dragging my heart around'*. For a former Jacobite, born late sixteen hundreds he had an unnatural obsession with modern technology. Several computer monitors lined the far wall, and two flat screen TVs broadcasted national and local news.

Joe looked up, acknowledging Jeremy with a sharp nod, and lowered the stereo volume with his universal remote. “I’m having a hard time identifying the source. That woman used a disposable phone, recently registered under a suspicious account.” Respect mingled with frustration as his fingers danced across the keyboard. “That’s all I’ve got so far.”

“Keep trying.”

Akasha stood in front of Jeremy, blocking his view, refusing to be ignored anymore. Questions spilled out in random succession. “What happened? What did Amber say? What did she want?”

Joe added his own comments. "The timing is curious, don’t you think?”

Jeremy didn’t like the implication. “She called because of my son.“ He looked at his sister. “His name is Joseph.”

“Joseph,” Akasha repeated with a soft smile. “And he is healthy?”

Jeremy hesitated. “I’m not sure. Amber believes he might be... *changing*.”

Her eyes narrowed. “You know that’s not possible. A shifter hasn’t been born in over three hundred years.”

“I’m aware of that. But Amber isn’t.”

Akasha frowned, turning her head to one side. “What did you tell her?”

“That he’s in danger; that he will die without my help.”

She gave a heavy sigh, tinged more with regret than censure. “More lies... Jeremy?”

“He’s my son. I will use any means necessary to get him home. And whatever it is that is happening to him has Amber spooked enough to call me. She has agreed to come.”

Akasha looked doubtful. “I hope so.”

“I’ve always known my wife to be completely candid about her intentions,” Jeremy reflected bitterly, remembering. 

*If you don’t let me get to my father’s funeral,* she had screamed, driving that last and most explosive disagreement home, *I will leave you.*

And she did.

“I’ll have the north rooms prepared for the boy.” Joe made an assumption Amber would be staying in the master suite. The north rooms were the most protected and easier to guard.

Jeremy stilled as an inner battle raged. Amber’s angry accusation buzzed fresh in his mind like an annoying swarm of hornets. And much like flying insects, forced confinement just pissed her off. He recalled the conversation; *You could have stayed* and her reply, *as a prisoner?*

He shook his head, making a decision that defied all natural instincts.

“She asked for the lake house, and that’s where she'll stay. At least for a few days until our guest has arrived.”

Akasha crossed her arms and regarded Jeremy with somber eyes. “In light of Amber’s return you might consider postponing the gathering.”

“Why? Her arrival changes nothing.” Jeremy frowned down at her, realizing he had been too soft earlier. What if she questioned his timing now, regardless of personal interpretation? “We are being watched by the Guardians. Should I just sit back and wait for more messages?”

Joe grunted a crude sound that confirmed his view of the subject.

“Of course not,” she snapped, offended. "But what of Amber and your son? How will she react once she’s learned what you have lured her back into?”

“They are safest with me, regardless.” Jeremy began to pace, annoyed by his sister’s insight. “My son is without training, helpless in a fight, weak as a human. Without me, he is vulnerable and ignorant, alone and unprotected.” Fear merged with disgust. “Besides, it’s imperative the gathering remain unnoticed. If all goes well, Amber won’t even know they’re here.”

“And if all doesn’t go well?”

“Then she’ll learn the reality of my world. I kept her too protected before. She accused me of making her a prisoner.”

“You did make her a prisoner,” Akasha pointed out, her sensitivity toward that particular subject well known.

“Well then,” Jeremy growled,” his patience with the conversation finished. “Maybe it’s time she understands why.”

Akasha walked toward him and placed a gentle hand on his arm, stilling his emotions and calming his anger. “Just don’t choose our safety over your happiness.” She lowered her voice. “I’ll not allow that a second time.”
