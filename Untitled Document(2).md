# Chapter 2

Jeremy escaped to his second floor study to clear his head. He poured himself a glass of scotch, leaned back in his perfectly worn leather recliner, and took a large gulp, savoring the smooth heat as it spread down his throat. Logs and paper had been stacked neatly in the fireplace, ready to be lit when necessary. Joe’s work, no doubt, even though he’d been told on countless occasions not to do menial tasks.

Loud voices and laughter filtered up from the main floor. Ratcliff hall had always been open to people of his territory. On most nights he enjoyed the sound of their contentment. On this night, however, he was on edge for many reasons.

Only a select few had been told of recent events, guards and defenders, all of them powerful, most of them shifters. The rest remained uninformed for one more night. A village meeting had been scheduled for the morning.

But, unfortunately, thoughts of his people were not his main cause of distraction. Oh no – he took another sip of his scotch –his restless conscience was all due to her. Always her. For reasons he was unaware of and could not control. Amber was heavy on his mind this night.

Like poison that refused to be purged, anger and fear churned in his gut. Worst of all was fear. And not knowing; Where were they? Was his child well? Were they hungry? Were they safe? Cold? Scared?

Alive?

A soft knock jarred Jeremy away from his self destructive thoughts. Akasha leaned into the doorjamb, with her Arbor Mist in one hand and a glass of red wine in the other. She wore black jeans and a plain white turtle neck shirt under her black leather jacket. She always dressed like the biker woman she was. Not many people dared mess with her. Jeremy and Cody had taught her to be herself growing up.

She took a sip from her glass. “Cody said you wanted to see me?”

“Come.” He waved her in with a purpose. Akasha set her glass on the butler’s table, settled into the sofa, and loosened the tie in her hair. She moaned as black waves fell around her shoulders. Very few saw his sister like this, relaxed, unguarded. Most only knew the kick ass biker. Although some, he realized, remembered the child who had been tortured by their mother in an effort to force transformation.

At one time, the Guardians wrongly believed that surreal instincts might call the wolf.

Not so for Akasha, no matter how brutal the sessions, and since a shift never occurred two thin scars remained on either side of her lower spine. The torture had been administered under the surface to produce the maximum amount of pain with the least damage. Their mother, if anything was prudent. Ginny would not have threatened her daughter’s beauty. Beauty had value. Sanity, not so much.

Akasha looked up, and then frowned. “You think of Ginny?”

Jeremy forced a smile. “Do you read minds now, too?”

“No need.” Sadness settled into her soft blue eyes.” You always get that distant look on your face when you think about our mother.”

“I’ll always regret leaving you with her.” Very rarely did either of them speak of that time. Why, he wondered, did he choose this moment to breach this subject? Weariness, perhaps? Her eyes widened. Had he never apologized? No, he supposed not. Apologies were for the weak.

Akasha swallowed hard and then took a deep breath, gathering courage to voice difficult memories. “Please don’t regret what cannot be changed. Everything happens for a reason. You were only thirteen and Cody needed you more. Ginny would have killed our brother, but not me.” Her voice softened to a whisper. “Besides, you came back for me.”

Her words didn’t lessen the guilt. Jeremy suspected they never would. Over sixteen hundred years had passed and he still remembered the night of his brother’s birth with regret.

It had been close to dawn when Aunt Marilyn barged into his round house, covered in blood. Wild–eyed and hysterical she handed him a wolf cub and said, “Run; run or watch your brother die.”

He had been forced to choose a sibling and he chose Cody. The first of their clan born in wolf form. Dumbfounded, Jeremy had ogled the black ball of fur mewling in his arms.

“Go to the high ground of Wolf Peak,” Aunt Marilyn had whispered as she tucked a wool cloak around the cub Jeremy held. “There are others like your brother. Families. They will help you.”

His disappearance, Jeremy knew, had harmed his sister more deeply than the metal spikes shoved under her skin.

“Justice has come full circle,” Akasha whispered

Jeremy looked up, dragging his way out of old memories. “How so?”

“We were chased from our homeland and forced to settle here, across the ocean, far away from the rest of our kind.” A thread of melancholy weaved through her voice, despite her harsh words.

“Has it been so bad?” he asked softly. It had taken a long time for her and many others to accept that Canada was no longer their home.

The Guardians had claimed their area of Canada that night like maggots within a rotting carcass. Descendants with mixed lineage or others considered beneath them, were forced to become servants or slaves. Or killed if judged too feeble in power, unworthy of procreation, dangerous to a weakening race losing its ability to call the wolf with each new generation.

A few powerful shifters had rejected the Guardians’ demands. Some, like Jeremy, had been unwilling to watch their loved ones suffer, and escaped to new lands.

A gathering with these other leaders was long overdue.

“Of course not,” she chided. “And you’re missing the point. In our absence Ginny has become barren of wolves, overrun with sheep and empty hills while we thrive. Our forest is rich with life. We have taken the precautions necessary to make sure that our land is protected against development. For some of us, wolves run through the trees once again; we are blessed.”

“Yes,” Jeremy agreed. “Perhaps a little too blessed. It will not be long before we are challenged.”

“I know. I feel it too.” She sighed, as if the weight of their conversation was a tangible substance. "Cody showed me the banner. Our time of peace has ended. Forgive me if I’m not so eager.”

“I’m not eager,” he argued. “But I will not bow down to the Guardians or their threats.”

“Like I would ever expect you too.” Akasha gave him a sad smile.” Because of me, you have become the leader of the unwanted. And you will defend our home at all cost.” She lowered her voice. “Even when your sacrifice is the greatest.”

Jeremy purposely ignored her last comment. The sacrifice referred to was not a place he chose to dwell. "No one is unwanted here.”

Over the years many had come for sanctuary, those in danger of Guardians’ judgment for either being too human or too wolf. Most stayed for a price. Anyone who lived on his land, under his protection, must cut all ties to their old life.

Full loyalty or else they must leave. No exceptions!!

Not even for the one woman who had deserved leniency; a human, no less, and innocent in this dangerous world.

Amber.

Again her name whispered through his mind muddling his thoughts with poisonous emotions. Anger, temptation, betrayal, hatred.

Need…

He got up and poured himself another glass of scotch.

“You will find them," Akasha offered as solace. “She can’t hide forever.”

Jeremy turned and frowned at his sister, more annoyed than angry at her insight. “When have I become so easy to read?”

“Only to me.” Her eyes fell to his glass. “I know what your loyalty to our people has cost you. Others don’t see. Or choose not to.” She shrugged. “Too many to count on your protection.”

He shook his head, uncomfortable with words. “Our numbers only make us stronger.”

Akasha sighed, but allowed him to veer away from his painful memories, switching to hers instead. “This is not how the guardians view me. Or others like me. To them, if we cannot shift, then we are weak. Forsaken. To them we will always be,”…she whispered a word in the old tongue, "Drwgddddwg.”

Evil bringer. A vile name created out of fear by ignorant leaders.

Jeremy growled. “Never use that name in my house.” Her profile did not conceal the mordant smile. “I’ve earned the right.”

Annoyance made his tone harsh. “We will be hosting a small gathering of leaders who have fertile land. Potential allies against the Guardians, those without loyalties to the old ways.” He gave her a moment to process that information, knowing that the news would unsettle her. And with good reason. “In numbers, our strength would be unmatched."

She hissed, snapping to face him. “If word reaches Canada that we are even discussing this –"

“You think I have not considered those consequences?”

"Does Cody know of your idea?”

“Yes.”

Akasha waited in reserved silence. Finally, with obvious hesitation she asked, “what are you thinking?”

Jeremy had considered territories first – the ones that had the most to lose under Guardian rule. “New York, Idaho, Virginia, Alaska, and maybe Minnesota.”

Akasha counted off the leaders of each of the territories on her fingers. Dylan, Caleb, Tiern, Isabel, and Grant. She held her hands. “Five. What about Brit? She will join us, I know it.”

“Yes I don’t doubt that Brit will stand with us, but she has her own battle at hand. Her territory is inconvenient. The humans in Russia were very observant of their surroundings. Or, perhaps, we’re more accepting of old superstitions. When the Soviets were in power they almost eradicated the wolf population, and not all of them, just the wolves.

Akasha frowned. “We should give her the choice. And the Himalayas? Both Rose and Edmund may join our cause."

"Let’s start closer to home. If all goes well, we can proceed from there.”

With a jerky nod, Akasha picked up her glass, rolling it in her hands. Potential disasters raced behind keen blue eyes. “When are you planning to hold this meeting?”

“Five days from now. Messages have already been sent. I will call tomorrow to confirm. I don’t want to give them too much time to think."

She let out a deep breath. “But enough time to respond."

Jeremy studied her face. “There will be powerful wolves around us, some who’ll remember.”

She met his eyes, unflinching, direct. I’m stronger than I once was.

“I know that. They don’t.”

Her lips tilted upward, mocking. “Are you asking me to behave?"

“Do I need to?"

“No,” she clipped.

“Good.”

“And I don’t want you or Cody hovering around me either.”

“You are our healer. We need you safe.”

She rolled her eyes. “That excuse has become tiresome. I can do more.”

Jeremy shrugged, unapologetic. "Then prepare the clinic for what will come if this gathering proves ineffective.”

Her chin lifted. “I’m always prepared for the worst.”

“Of course.”

“We may need to add more beds in the future,” she conceded.

“I will defer to your judgment. Order anything you think necessary.”

A muffled ring came from her pocket. She smiled an apology, leaning to the side to retrieve her cell.

The unnatural sound was like acid on his nerves. “I wish you wouldn’t carry that thing.”

“You’re so paranoid.” She teased. “Joe keeps me protected. And this thing has freed me from living at the clinic. The convenience far outweighs the risk.” She looked down at the incoming number, and raised her eyebrows. “Joe.”

Jeremy stilled his instincts on alert. Joe never wasted words – or his time. If he called there was a valid reason.

“Hello. Yes he’s here with me.” Akasha met Jeremy’s stare, her eyes intense. "Do you want to talk to him?” She blinked, staring down at the phone, then back to Jeremy. “Joe just hung up on me.”
