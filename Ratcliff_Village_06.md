# Chapter 6

Jeremy drove in silence, a feeling of complete fulfillment spreading out from his chest and into his limbs. Amber had cared well for their son. Joseph was strong and healthy; and he was *here*… where he belongs.
 
Unable to stop himself, Jeremy took another sidelong glance. It was odd, and more than a little overwhelming, to see one’s own features on another being.
 
Joseph sat with his legs spread wide, taking up the whole passenger seat, his hands drumming softly against the dashboard.
 
Jeremy had not felt such peace in a very long time.
 
A turn in the road came into view and on impulse he veered his truck to the left, choosing the long way to the clinic. He heard Amber shift in the backseat as she became aware of the detour.
 
Jeremy watched her in the rear-view mirror. Her profile was clean of paint, her complexion drawn by anger or strain, or both. Her jaw clenched as she stared out the window, trying hard to ignore his presence. Her light brown hair cascaded down her back in thick waves. He’d always known her to keep it short.
 
She wore jeans and a navy sweatshirt and looked very much like the college intern he’d met sixteen years ago. She had not aged. He wondered if she had realized that.
 
“What has your mother told you of me?” 
 
Joseph straightened, his hands dropping to his legs, and he glanced over his shoulder towards the back seat. It angered Jeremy that he looked to her first for approval.
 
“Just tell your father the truth,” Amber said.
 
“Um, well, I know you have a huge house that looks like a stone fort and a lot of people live there. You watch out for everyone in your town like they’re your responsibility. I have an uncle named Cody, and an aunt named Akasha who is a doctor. They were nice to mom when she lived here.”
 
The last was said as if everyone else was unkind to Amber. ”How many other lies has she told you? Do you know how your mother and I met?”
 
Joseph nodded. “You rented her the lake home. She worked as a wildlife biologist on a research team from the University of Maine and was trying to reintroduce caribou back into the Katahdin region. You guys ended up spending the summer together until Mom found out that she was pregnant with me. She quit her job and moved in with you.”
 
The accounting was too guarded for Jeremy’s satisfaction.
 
“Did she tell you about her time in Rhuddin Hall? And please don’t moderate.”
 
“I’m not,” Joseph’s defense of his mother was immediate. “You were always worried about her and kept people around her. She was very sad because you wouldn’t let her call Grandma. She found out my grandfather died after seeing an obituary in the paper. You wouldn’t let her go to the funeral. You guys had a big fight over it.” 
 
He paused, his eyes shifted to the backseat.
 
“Go on,” Amber urged.
 
“Mom didn’t understand why you were so weird about her leaving– then one night you showed her why.” He didn’t give specifics but his voice indicated that he knew. 
 
“Just before you–” Joseph cleared his throat, “--changed, you told her she could leave after I was born, but without me. So she left before I was born.”
 
Although biased, the accounting was fairly accurate. Jeremy had expected worse. However there was an odd tone to his son’s voice. “What are you not telling me?”
 
“Nothing!” Joseph growled. “I don’t know. I just don’t think you knew mom that well or you’d never have made that offer. That’s all.”
 
“That’s all.”
 
Jeremy gripped the steering wheel, trying hard to keep the anger from his voice. It seemed Amber had omitted an important piece of information that their son deserved to know.
 
“My words and actions might seem unfair to you, but I had my reasons. Your mother and I were wedded that summer she stayed at the lake house. When she moved into my house we were husband and wife.”
 
Amber hissed from the backseat no longer ignoring his presence. “I don’t believe that wedding was entirely legal.”
 
He met her glare in the rear-view mirror, deciding with some satisfaction that he preferred her anger to indifference.
 
“Do your oaths mean nothing, wife? Because I assure you I don’t make vows unless I mean to keep them.”
 
“We were never in a church,” she growled out, a forced calm in front of their son.”As far as I’m concerned that ceremony was just a romantic gesture in the woods. There was no minister present, or a priest, or a justice of the peace, for that matter, and I know we never signed any papers.”
 
“We were in *my* church and I don’t need a clergyman or clerk to validate my vows. And documents are useless letters easily destroyed.”
 
*And you are my mate,* his wolf growled silently, flexing his teeth along Jeremy’s spine. *An unbreakable bond; your human vows are insignificant in comparison.*
 
His jaw hung open, rendering her momentarily speechless. Joseph remained quiet in the passenger seat, although a slight grin tugged at his lips.
 
“Don’t even think about it,” Amber found her voice and its warning tone was aimed directly at their son.
 
“Awwww… Come on, mom.” He looked over his shoulder, his eyes aglow with potential trouble. “Grandma should know.”
 
“Grandma won’t recognize anything not blessed by a minister.”
 
Jeremy stored that information away for later and addressed another issue about his son’s account that bothered him. “I had valid reasons for wanting your mother to separate from her old life, even her family. It was for her protection and theirs, and now that you’re here, you’ll learn the whole of it… and you’ll understand my side.”
 
Amber cleared her throat. “I only recently gave Joseph the full details about… the last time I saw you. I told him two weeks ago, when I could no longer delude myself that he wasn’t experiencing similar traits.”
 
Jeremy grew annoyed with the evasive wordplay. “You know I can turn into a wolf?”
 
Joseph nodded. “Yeah, mom wanted me to know just in case I inherited the same, um, talent.”
 
“And were you surprised to hear of such a thing?”
 
“Not really.” He rolled his eyes towards the back seat. But if you haven’t noticed, Mom is a little freaked out about it.”
 
“*Not really?*”
 
Curious now, Jeremy pulled over to the side of the road and opened the passenger side window. “What do you hear in the forest, Joseph?”
 
He nodded with understanding and accepted the challenge. “There is a bird making a nest a few yards away,” he said, pointing to a grove of young cedars. “Two deer are foraging for food over there.” 
 
He closed his eyes concentrating on the sounds. “A man and a woman are whispering a short distance up the road.” He opened his eyes and gave a confident smile. “They just stopped.”
 
Jeremy forced himself to stay calm. The man and woman he referred to were guards, Ceri and Gabriel, and they were more than a short distance away. “How long have your senses been heightened?”
 
“I don’t know,” Joseph said. “Always, I guess. I’ve always known I’ve been different from other kids, stronger. But in the last three weeks I’ve felt - more.” He shot a sidelong glance towards his mother. “I feel things I haven’t before.”
 
“Like what?” Jeremy’s heart slammed against his chest. “What do you feel?”
 
“Like,” Joseph’s voice dropped to a low growl not entirely human, “*power*.”
 
Jeremy hissed, sensing the whispers of energy dance along his skin, called not by him, but by his son.
 
Sweet Mother. Was it possible? Did he dare allow himself to hope for such a thing? 
 
“What is that?” Amber asked, her voice anxious.
 
“A gift,” Jeremy whispered. “An unbelievable gift. Do you know what the power can do, Joseph?”
 
He blinked slowly. “I think so.” Not tested then, not fully.
 
“You’ll learn.” Unable to contain his joy, Jeremy reached over and grabbed his son by the shoulder to give a reassuring squeeze. “I’ll teach you.”
 
“When?” he asked eagerly.
 
“Soon.”
 
“Is Joseph going to be okay?” Amber demanded, leaning forward, inches from his face.
 
He turned to her a brush of movement before she jumped back.
 
He ground his teeth against her fleeting scent. “As long as he stays with me he’ll be fine.”
 
“And how long will that take?” Suspicion and fear laced her voice.
 
Jeremy evaded her question with one of his own. “Did anything change in Joseph’s life three weeks ago?”
 
She frowned then. “No, not that I can think of.” Her eyes turned toward their son, shrewd and guessing. “Unless I’m not aware of it.”
 
“No, nothing.” Joseph confirmed. “At least I don’t think so. I like where we live now. It’s been nice not moving around so much.”
 
“Ah,” Jeremy said.
 
“What?” Ambers voice turned frantic.
 
“Joseph’s wolf might have remained doormat because his environment was constantly changing…unsteady.”
 
Her brown eyes snapped with gold fire. “He’s always been protected…and loved, no matter where we lived.”
 
“But he probably sensed your anxiety,” Jeremy explained. “He wasn’t given enough time to settle, to feel secure in his surroundings…until recently. Am I right?”
 
Amber remained silent, and Jeremy pressed his point. “How long have you lived in your current location?” It took a great deal of self control not to ask where that location was, specifically.
“Four years,” She admitted with obvious reluctance. “So this change has nothing to do with hormones? I thought maybe… I don’t know. Puberty might have brought this on?”
 
“Oh, gosh, mom,” Joseph rolled his eyes, disgusted. “You’re like a few years too late for that question!”
 
Jeremy had a hard time keeping his grin contained. “No, age is irrelevant.”
 
“Okay,” Amber exhaled softly. “But is he going to be okay, now that,” she swallowed, “now that his wolf is no longer dormant?”
 
“I promise you.” Jeremy said calmly, trying to ease her concern. “If he stays with me, no harm will come to him. You must understand that.”
 
“I am here, aren’t I?” She pressed back into her seat, crossing her arms. “If Joseph wants to stay, we will. If not…”
 
“I want to stay mom.” Obviously sensing the undercurrents of his parents, he hedged. ”Mom can stay too, right?”
 
Jeremy swallowed a pleased snarl. He had her.
 
“Only if she wants to.”
 
“If I’m here,” Joseph said with confidence, “Mom will want to stay.” The unguarded statement revealed a great deal about their relationship. His son had only known love from his mother.
 
Jeremy felt his beast sigh with satisfaction. “Your mother is aware of my conditions. They haven’t changed. There must be no contact with anyone outside our territory.”
 
A look passed between mother and son, a questioning glance from Joseph answered by a sharp frown from Amber. The distrust left a vile taste on Jeremy’s tongue. “There are five hundred people living in Rhuddin Village under my protection. I refuse to have their welfare compromised. Their lives are no less valuable than ours.”
 
“That shouldn’t be a problem.” Joseph blurted out. “We have no one of importance to contact. Right, mom? Grandma’s already here and I’m here. There’s no one else, well, besides Mr. Ayes. But he isn’t family.”
 
“He’s my boss.” Amber explained, her voice dry. “Nothing more. He does deserve a call, however, and he will be getting one!”
