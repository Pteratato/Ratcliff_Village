#Chapter 8
--

Jeremy found himself at the receiving end of an angry woman’s displeasure, one who should be groveling for forgiveness and not leveling him with a very astute glare.

“Joseph is not the least bit in danger of dying, is he?”

He saw no reason to carry the untruth any further. “No, not unless vital organs are removed from his body.”

She pursed her lips at his blunt response. “But he’s different?” she exhaled softly, amending her words. “Well, *different* even for your kind?”

Again, very perceptive. “Not exactly?”

“Can you just give me a straight answer for once?

“You speak to me with venom in your voice and yet I’m not the one whose actions require atonement. So choose your words wisely from now on, because your audacity has reached its limit.”

She sighed then, an anguished sound that called to his soul, if he even had a soul. With her it seemed that he must, because he always felt tortured in her presence.

“You’re angry, and you have every right to hate me for what I’ve done.” She lifted her hand in a helpless gesture before letting it fall back to her side. “But if our situations were reversed, you would have done the same thing.”

“Never, Amber. I would have never kept you from our son.”

Her features pinched. Whether from guilt or anger he wasn’t sure, nor did he care.

“You’re so certain,” she said, “so quick to judge. But then you never considered my position in your life. You just expected me to conform.”

“I expected you to trust me,” he ground out.

Her eyes widened. “*Trust you*? How do you trust someone who’s suffocating you? I couldn’t breathe without you or someone hovering over me, watching me – following me. I was constantly guarded by people who despised me, not permitted to contact my family –“

“I was protecting you!”

“You were protecting *your secret*,” she snapped. “And when my father died, you wouldn’t even let me go to the funeral.”

“The man had already passed on. Your presence over his dead body would not change that fact.”

She went completely still. “And how does that justify your response to my grief? You locked me in a room like…” Her voice shook with raw anger. “Like a dog. You made me a prisoner–“

“You were threatening to leave me.“

“-- and then you dragged me through the woods and changed into a… a wolf! And, if that wasn’t enough, just before your little demonstration you gave me an option to leave, but without my child.” When he didn’t respond she glared at him as if he were the king of idiots. “And you wonder why I left you?”

With great effort he managed to keep his voice restrained. “I would never have made that offer if I’d known how much you wanted our child.”

She scoffed. “Every mother wants her child.”

*No*, he thought, *not every mother.* 

“There are more lives at stake here than just yours or mine, or even our son’s.”

“I didn’t betray your secret.” She said, misunderstanding his point. “Joseph is the only one I told.”

“I believe you.” Unfortunately, that wasn’t the betrayal that had caused him over a decade of sleepless nights.

She sighed, pinching the bridge of her delicate nose. “Fighting will not solve our differences. Can I make a suggestion?”

“I’m listening.” He crossed his arms, leery of her sudden tone of cooperation.

“I will answer any questions you have for me, truthfully – if you do the same.” 

It wasn’t, Jeremy decided, an unreasonable request. “What do you want to know?’

“What’s different about Joseph that you’re not telling me?”

He regarded her for a long moment before answering. It was time he agreed to end her ignorance. “A shifter hasn’t been born in over three hundred years. So, if our son is powerful enough to change into the wolf, it will be an incredible blessing for me and my people.”

She frowned, absorbing that information, and not, it seemed, particularly pleased with the idea of her son becoming a wolf.

“Tough crap. You’re a shifter?”

“Yes.” He knew where this was going. 

“How old are you?” 

He hesitated for only a moment and then answered with blunt honesty. Whether she believed him or not was irrelevant. The time for lies had ended the moment Amber entered his territory. She was never leaving again.

“I was born 329 years after the modern calendar lists the birth of Christ. In a place called Penllyn. You would know my country as Wales.”

She remained quiet for some moments. 

“I would call you a liar or a lunatic if I had not watched you change from a man into a wolf with my very own eyes.” She gave a soft laugh, a calming means of preservation when the mind was forced to accept what it didn’t understand. “The only thing I’m sure of is how much I don’t know about this world.”

“That night in the woods was my attempt to open your eyes and teach you, although I must admit now that I may have been over-enthusiastic in my approach.” His attempt at humor was rewarded with a slight smile.

“Wales, early fourth century,“ she mused. “Celtic then, pagan?”

He nodded, his eyes drawn to her full mouth as she worried her bottom lip, taunting him with desire that he didn’t want.

Soft brown eyes lifted to his, unguarded and without malice. “That explains a lot.”

This conversation had taken a dangerous turn. In the face of anger he could resist her but not like this – not with her looking up at him with newfound understanding. It was her gentle nature that had drawn him to her in the beginning. He could do nothing but respond like – “what?”

“Your beliefs, the way you live, your fortress of a home,” she lifted one delicate shoulder and let it fall, causing light to dance around her long curls, “your dominant temperament.”

“The last is from my wolf.” The treacherous beast that wanted to reach out and snag one of those curls and inhale its texture.

“Joseph has your eyes,” she whispered. “Those are not the eyes of a Celt or a wolf.”

“Roman,” he supplied, taking a step back before he gave into her laser instincts. “My father was a legendary commander during the Roman occupation of Britain, my mother an Egyptian slave.”

She blinked twice and began to rub her temples. “Are your parents still alive?” 

“No, not my father. He wasn’t of our kind.”

“Neither am I,” she said softly. “How long could Joseph live?”

“Thousands of years.”

Still, denial lingered. “But he’s aged normally?”

“Our children age at the normal human rate until adolescence. But then the aging process slows.” He waited for her to assimilate the information before moving on to something he knew would truly unsettle her. “The way your aging has slowed since carrying our son.”

Her expression again turned wary – “You said your father was no longer alive because he wasn’t one of your kind?”

“It’s different for mothers,” he explained. “You carried my son, shared your blood with his for over nine months. Because of the biological bond and incubation of our blood with yours, you’ll live much longer than you’ve assumed.”

He did not, however, inform her of the rarity of conceiving a male of his kind.

Amber had initiated their affair that fateful summer. He had accepted the pleasant distraction only because he’d thought nothing would come of it. Obviously he had been wrong. Just one of many misjudgments concerning this woman.

“Let me get this straight,” her voice was thick with disbelief. “Are you saying that I could live over a thousand years?”

“That’s very possible.”

“As long as no vital organs are removed,” she added with a smile.

He would kill anyone who dared try.

She slowly slid into a waiting chair, resting her face in her hands. He left her alone, a difficult stance when all his instincts itched to pull her into his arms.

Finally, she lifted her head. “You’re not messing with me, are you?”

“Why would I lie about something that will only be proven in time?” He sighed at her lowered glare. “It’s been sixteen years and you look the same; have you not noticed?”

“Women in my family age very well,” she said defensively.

“Not that well.” And just to prove his point – or so he justified himself – he stepped forward and ran a finger down the smooth perfection of her cheek. “The sooner you accept that you’re part of my world the easier it will be for you to accept your fate.”

She leaned away from his touch, visibly shaken. He let his hand drop to his side as an inner battle raged. He’d underestimated the effect of one simple touch. He’d been denied physical comfort for far too long.

“And what is that supposed to mean?” Amber asked, oblivious of her hot precarious position. “I don’t believe in fate. I believe in choice and free will.”

He gave a bitter laugh. “You’ll learn there are some things beyond our control, and that we are just pawns to a higher power.”

That annoyed her. “Fine but how am I supposed to accept my fate, as you call it, if I don’t even know what you are?” She held up her hands waiting for an explanation. “What are you? Shape shifters, werewolves? How is that possible? Are you even from this Earth?”

“Shape shifters are an apt term.” He did his best not to smile at her naïve questions. “And yes, we are from this Earth, but werewolves are just a legend.”

“Then you’re not allergic to silver?” When he hesitated, she blurted, “I am only asking for Joseph’s sake.”

“We are not allergic to silver.” He let his eyes drop to her waist having noticed earlier she favored her right side. “That gun under your sweatshirt won’t protect you whether it’s loaded with silver bullets or lead.” 

She remained silent. He suspected that she had other weapons or she would have shown more concern. “Nor are we compelled by the full moon. However some of the elders still shift on the night of the dark moon to honor the goddess Cerridwen. I would not be surprised if the werewolf legend began with an unknown witness to a ritual, thousands of years ago.”

“And how do you shift?”

He gave thoughtful consideration to his answer, knowing a woman born in modern times would only understand the scientific explanation. “The earth is a powerful instrument, creation is constant. The same element that makes a seed grow into a tree, an animal age, and winter turn into spring, can be used in different applications if you know what to look for and how to draw from its energy.” He saved the full explanation for another time. Better to let her adjust in increments; Amber didn’t react well to surprises she didn’t like.

“Now I think it’s your turn to answer my questions and I expect the same honesty that I’ve given you...”

She crossed her arms in front of her chest. “I’m always honest. You’ve always just chosen not to listen.”

“How could you have done it?” He wasn’t sure who was more surprised by his first question, him or Amber. “How could you have taken my son? How could you have left me? Did you even think of me, just once?”

“Of course,” she lifted her hand to touch his arm, but for some reason let it drop. “How could I not? I almost called you the night Joseph was born. He was so beautiful that I wanted to share that with you. I even dialed your number.”

He scowled. “Why would you tell me this other than to torment me?”

“I’ve given you no reason to believe me, I know, but I never wanted to hurt you.” Conflicting emotions bled from her pores in a murky spiral of scents; sorrow, bitterness, frustration, and beneath them all the pungent smell of fear. “Did it ever occur to you that I might have valid reasons for staying away?”

His nostrils flared. He inhaled slowly, savoring the evidence of her remorse on the back of his tongue like a perfectly aged Scottish Whisky. “I can think of none worth what you’ve put me through.” He turned his back on her, feeling his wolf react in earnest. “Do you have any idea what it was like for me? Wondering if you were alive, wondering about my child?” He heard a whisper or movement, then he felt a tentative hand on his shoulder. When he didn’t shove her off she moved closer.

“And for that,” she whispered, “I am truly sorry. I was scared, Jeremy. Scared of losing my son.”

He had no argument against an assumption caused by his own words. “Did you teach Joseph to fear me?”

“No!” she released his arm and walked away. “I taught him not to trust the people around you.”

His chest tightened by her admission. “Why would you do such a thing?”

She now faced him with a hard expression, reminding him of a warrior after a first kill, of innocence lost. “Because the people you’re so eager to defend aren’t worthy of our trust.”

“What have they done to you to warrant such dislike?”

She tilted her head to one side. “You have no idea, do you?” She shrugged. “But then why would you? I made certain you wouldn’t.”

“Speak openly… your evasive words grow tiresome.”

“Then I’ll save you the details.” A dead calm stole over her. “But there is something you should know… Sean found me in the woods that night that I ran from you. I convinced her to let me go by telling her my child wasn’t yours. However, she threatened to kill us if we ever returned and I have every reason to believe she’d try.”

Her words robbed him of air. He had no memory of Sean from that night. But, if she had found Amber and not told him…

“Sean has been contained.” He said quietly. “I will investigate your claims, if they prove true then she’ll be punished accordingly.”

“If they prove true?” she sneered, shaking her head as if the betrayal of their past was his fault alone. “You are blind when it comes to your people. I was stupid to believe that anything I might say would change your mind.”

“I’m *protective*.” He corrected. “And I told you I would investigate your claims.”

She gave him an odd smile. “Do you know the main reason why I didn’t call you that night?”

He remained silent, waiting to hear her reasoning, no matter how irrational, because whether they were true or not Amber believed them.

“It was for Joseph’s safety,” she continued. “I’ve waited until he was strong enough to defend himself against the people you are so eager to protect.”

Her lack of trust in his ability to keep their son safe left a foul taste in the air. His voice lowered to a soft growl. “No harm will come to you,” he vowed, “or to my son while you’re on my territory. I will make certain of it.”

“Thank you,” she said, sounding genuinely relieved. Her gratitude annoyed him; their safety should be expected, not appreciated.

“I still have a few questions I would like you to answer.”

“I’m sure you do.”

“Has anyone helped you since that night in the woods?” He found it incomprehensible that she’d been able to hide from him all this time. She had no idea of the lengths he had gone to find her.

“Not in the manner you’re suggesting. The only help I’ve gotten was from family and old friends, nothing that was connected to you. And not once did I betray your secret.”

“Where have you been?” Thanks to Joe he knew she had made her first call from Providence. It had taken the guard a good amount of time to locate her signal, but by morning he’d been able to report some useful findings – and yet not nearly enough for Jeremy’s satisfaction.

“I didn’t leave the country,” she admitted, still protecting something or someone. “I taught grade school until the finger-printing laws started to take effect. Then most recently I’ve been working as a chef and a housekeeper for a nice employer.”

“Mr. Ayers,” he supplied dryly.

“Yes,” her tone dropped in warning. “And I would be very angry if you tracked this person down and questioned him. He knows nothing of my past. He is innocent.”

“I promise not to track him down if you promise not to run.”

“I’m not going anywhere, Jeremy, as long as Joseph wants to stay.” She lifted her hands and let them fall back to her side. “I only ask that you work with me, to at least be civil with me in front of our son.”

He frowned not knowing how to respond to such a rational request. “Agreed.”

“I know my son,” she sighed with resigned acceptance. “I’m not sure how long he wants to stay, but I have a feeling it might be awhile.”

“*Our* son,” he corrected quietly, “is old enough to make his own decisions.”

“I know that,” she said softly. “He’ll need to enroll in school, and I’ll have to commute to find a job.” She began to pace, a delicate frown creasing her forehead. ”But Bangor’s only an hour away. If it’s not in your territory then it must be somewhat close. You can make a compromise, I’m sure, if you really want to?” A sparkle of hope lifted her features, her voice turned wistful. “I’d love to teach again.”

“Teach? Commute to a job?” Being with Amber was equivalent to standing on a small ship during a nasty storm, the ground beneath his feet constantly unstable and threatening to toss him out on his butt.

“Will you rent me the lake house?” she asked cheerfully.

“Rent you the lake house?” he spat, livid once again now that the words sunk in. “You’re not a servant. I don’t expect payment from you to live here. I’ll provide whatever you need. You’re my –“

“Don’t even say it.” Her eyes narrowed. “Don’t you dare. I don’t acknowledge those vows as a marriage. if you still do then I’m sorry and I release you from them. Even ancient pagans recognized divorce.” She said with just a tad too much knowledge for her own well-being.

Jeremy bared his teeth as his beast clawed at his spine demanding a voice. “We have a son together. There’ll be no divorce. You are my mate.”

She opened her mouth to object, and then snapped it shut. “We can discuss this at a later time.”

He shrugged. She could talk whenever she wanted and for however long she wanted. Years, decades, centuries, it was irrelevant. His decision on this matter was nonnegotiable. However, he needed to think further on her request to teach. If it would pacify her, perhaps he could find a way to make it happen without compromising her safety.

“We have eight children here in the village,” he said. “Gwenevere is their classroom teacher. I’m sure she’d appreciate your help anytime. She can also tutor Joseph if necessary.”

“You can’t be serious?” Amber stared at him in stunned shock. “You haven’t been listening to me, Jeremy. The people in your village hate me. And that was before I ran away with your son. I can’t even imagine how they’ll react now that they actually have a reason to.” She laughed, and it wasn’t a pleasant sound. “They certainly won’t let me anywhere near their children, that’s for sure.”

“They are wary by nature.” He explained, keeping his voice calm to her prejudice. “You didn’t give them enough time. “

“Whatever you say.” Submissive words laced with malevolence, as if arguing suddenly became a waste of her time.

“You can’t live as you were.” He sensed her determination, her unbreakable will. She fully intended to do whatever she pleased even if it went against his wishes.

“Really?” Her chin lifted only to validate his concern. “Why can’t I?”

“There are precautions that must be taken.” He clenched his hands by his sides in frustration. “The knowledge of our kind can never be revealed. You must come to terms with that.”

“And how high a price will I have to pay under your terms?”

He tried to defuse her ire with truth. “There are others of my kind who will eliminate any threats to our race.”

“I’m not a threat. Unless,” she amended, her eyes narrowing with a dangerous light so unlike her former self that it took him by surprise, “they come after my son.”

A real possibility he kept to himself. “I’m grateful that you and Joseph are here now, healthy and unharmed.”

“Are you trying to scare me?”

“My motivation has always been to keep you safe.”

From the other side of the building, Jeremy heard the soft click of a closing door. Footsteps approached, one heavy and one light. Joseph and Akasha appeared around the corner a moment later, halting their conversation. Akasha commanded his attention with her expression, her face aglow in awe. She whispered in the old tongue, “He’s whole. The goddess has blessed us, brother. Your son is whole.”

Jeremy closed his eyes briefly at the confirmation of what he’d already suspected. Still, he refused to celebrate, not until he saw his son change with his own eyes. Joseph was whole, according to Akasha’s special gift, and he was able to call the wolf.

Soon, goddess willing, they would know for sure. Amber pulled Joseph aside, the concern in her voice palpable. “Are you okay?”

He rolled his eyes. “Chill, mom. I’m fine. Aunt Akasha just listened to my heart rate and did a few other tests.” He grinned then. “I think I passed.”

“Aunt Akasha, is it?” Jeremy smiled. So did his sister. “You passed.”

His wife however, wasn’t smiling when she leveled him with a searching glare. “Should I be relieved or concerned?”

Akasha looked at Jeremy. “Can I speak openly?”

“Yes, we will no longer protect my wife from the truth. I believe she is ready to hear it.”

His sister nodded with approval, not inclined to soften her words. “Joseph is powerful enough to shift into the wolf. Are you strong enough to handle that? If so, then be relieved. If not, be concerned.”

Amber flinched, unaware that Akasha had been her greatest defender. ”You have no idea what I’d do for my son.”

“No, I don’t.” Akasha crossed her arms in front of her chest. “But then, whose fault is that?”

Amber turned her back on them and ran a gentle hand down Joseph’s arm, searching his face. “I’m strong enough to handle anything but losing you.”

“I know, mom.” He nudged her with his shoulder. “Are you ready for a new adventure?” 

By the look on Amber’s face, the simple question had personal significance. It made Jeremy painfully aware of his exclusion from their life.

Amber laughed and it was a musical sound of pure love and acceptance. It was, Jeremy recognized, a sound he’d never heard from her.

It made him ache.

“You’re accepting the news better than expected,” he said dryly.

Her smile faded when turned upon him. “I had already accepted the possibility when I called you.”

Of course she had, he thought bitterly, or else she would never have made the call.
