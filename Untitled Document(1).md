# Chapter 1

Another war was inevitable.
 
Jeremy felt this with utter certainty. The Wolf mountain territory had remained unspoiled over the years by human progress - due to his calculated precautionary nature - and thrived in untouched glory, raw and powerful, a precious achievement during these modern times.
 
An achievement his enemies coveted.
 
“It’s a message,” Jeremy said with deliberate calm as he watched his brother stalk across the kitchen.
 
“No kidding, “ Cody snapped, throwing a crumpled ball of linen in Jeremy’s direction. Dressed only in a pair of faded jeans with wild black hair tangled above bare shoulders, Cody looked just as much a predator now as he did in wolf form. His skin was absent of tattoos indicating that he had shifted in haste, a warning to those who knew him well to tread lightly.
 
Jeremy snatched the item in midair and smoothed it out on the wooden island. It was blue linen with a brown and black eagle embroidered across the top, circled by a Celtic knot. That knot was the Royal banner of the Wolf Peak Mountain, the original of their kind, the guardians, victorious, powerful and without conscious self- appointed protectors of the race.

They’re inbred butt holes, the lot of them.
 
He traced the hand-hewn embroidery of the banner. “Where was it found?”
 
“On the north ridge.” A dangerous light sparked in Cody’s silver eyes, promising vengeance. “Tied to the Great Oak.”
 
The tree stood a short distance from the north entrance to their territory. Not a direct challenge. Not yet. But the message was clear; We are watching you.
 
“It seems,” - Jeremy brushed the banner to the side, his inner battle carefully masked by a calm exterior - “that the Guardians are restless.”
 
“We must respond.”
 
“I know,” Jeremy growled.  The walls of his control began to fracture. His wolf didn’t understand politics or passivity.
 
It wanted the blood of the idiot who dared challenge his dominance.
 
He walked over to the sink, shoved open the window, and breathed in the fresh spring air. The scent of his forest, pine and wet earth, soothed the animal within.
 
Cody stilled, watching, waiting, utterly quiet - a pose unnatural to a wolf just as dominant, just as powerful as Jeremy.
 
“We will respond,” Jeremy continued after a few minutes, arriving at a dangerous decision. “But not in the expected way. I’m going forward with the plan as discussed. It’s time to gather with other leaders who have valued territories.” They were leaders without loyalties with the Guardians.
 
Cody stayed silent for several minutes, and then gave a sharp nod. “I just wonder who’ll have the guts to come.”
 
“All of them,” Jeremy surmised, “out of curiosity or need.”
 
“Or deceit.”
 
“That too.”
 
“But they are Celts,” Cody, sounded more persuaded by that simple fact. Celts protected their people.
 
They were also suspicious, stubborn fools, unwilling to follow any form of leadership other than their own. Add a little wolf blood to the mix and any gathering had the potential to be downright volatile, as history had proven countless times.
 
“So be it.” A malicious smile of anticipation spread across Cody’s face. The time is ripe for a gathering.
 
Jeremy ignored his brother’s comment as he looked out of the kitchen window. Spring was quite possibly the worst time of year for a gathering of their kind.
 
Orange hues from the setting sun filtered through bare branches, forming dark silhouettes against the horizon. His forest looked dormant, with brown fields and patches of snow lingering in sunless areas. However, Jeremy knew the truth, as did his brother, as would anyone with wolf blood running through his or her veins. Underneath the shroud of a waning winter, plants grew, buds formed, animals ended their hibernation; Life awakened. Its energy hummed along his skin like a thousand fingers, whispering promises of power. “We must watch our sister closely.”
 
“Akasha can take care of herself.”
 
Jeremy braced his arms on the counter, letting his head fall forward., “That’s what concerns me.”
 
Cody chuckled, a sound more sardonic thant amused. “It may be time we revealed our own strength.”
 
“If our enemies push us,” Jeremy said, looking over his shoulder to meet his brother’s gaze. ”They will learn soon enough.”
 
Cody crossed his arms and leaned on the center island, his relaxed stance a controlled deception. “I suggest we call everyone in from the cities.”
 
“Agreed.” A few of their people lived amongst pure humans, secret ambassadors of sorts, as was necessary to influence the laws of an accelerating world. “Let’s bring all our people home.”

– 

Amber Ratcliff stood outside the Wolf Mountain Peak Public Library trying to decide who was more insane, the homeless preacher man practicing a colorful sermon on a milk crate or her, as she punched in Jeremy’s number on her shiny new disposable prepaid phone.
 
There was a strong possibility that she may have won the crazy contest, considering the man she was about to call had been hunting her for over fifteen years.
 
Amber hugged her jacket close as a chill shuddered down her spine. She had traveled into the city specifically to activate the phone using a public computer at the library. Her location needed to be as untracetable as possible. Was she being a tad paranoid? Heck yes, hiding from a man who wasn’t exactly human had taught her a few lessons. Questions flooded her thoughts, weakening her resolve. What if Jeremy wasn’t there? What if the number had been changed? What if he refuses to accept the call, deciding instead to contact her on his own terms? To hunt her down and trap her?
 
Calm down, she coached herself, taking a deep breath, just press the little green button for Joseph.
 
The transient paused in his sermons, adjusting a rainbow- colored beret over matted brown and gray hair. A cool breeze carried his stench;, mildew, unwashed skin, and alcohol. Amber thought he had paused for dramatic effect, but then large brown eyes met hers.
 
“Are you okay, child?”
 
Child? For the love of God, she was thirty- six years old, and  pathetic. Yet a drunken, homeless preacher was asking her if she needed help.
 
“I’m fine,.” she answered back with a tight smile, simply because her mother had taught her never to be rude. Her mother had also taught her not to be a coward. The man didn’t look too convinced,- no surprise there, neither was she.
 
Amber turned her back on him and walked a short distance down the sidewalk. The street lights flickered on, mingling with head lights from passing traffic. Either she was going to make the call, or brave Wolf Peak Mountain traffic during rush hour.
 
She pushed the button and held the receiver to her ear.
 
Six rings, then a terse, “Hello.” Male, but not Jeremy.
 
Her breath whooshed out. But the rush of relief lasted only moments until reality forced her to form coherent words. “Is Jeremy available?”
 
“No! Are you wanting to leave a message?”
 
Joe, she guessed. One of Jeremy’s guard dogs - a tattooed skinhead on steroids. The despicable had locked her in Jeremy’s room once. She had escaped under his watch. That thought gave her some satisfaction. She cleared her throat, gaining courage.
 
“This is Amber.”
 
Silence.
 
WaIs it a sin to gain pleasure at someone else’s discomfort?  Probably. A small part of her enjoyed it anyway. “I will be at this number for another hour. If Jeremy wants to talk to me, have him return my call.” Three heart beats later, she added, “It concerns his son.”
 
No answer.
 
“Are you still there?”
 
“Yes.” Tthe single, clipped word screamed, “Witch!”
 
She gave Joe the number and hung up.

She tucked her phone into her coat pocket. To keep busy, she grabbed her purse, found twenty dollars, and walked over to the homeless preacher.
 
He reached out a gloved hand but paused when a passerby snapped, “He’ll only drink it away.” Amber turned to the middle - aged woman, dressed in a casual coat and jeans. “Maybe that’s what he needs to survive this world.”
 
The woman shrugged and kept walking.
 
“God bless you, Child.” The transient snatched the money. “I’ll pray for you.”
 
“Thank you, sir.” Amber fingered the phone in her pocket. ”I need all the prayers I can get.”
 
She searched the area for a secluded place to wait and headed toward a vacant park across the street. There was no grass in this section of the city, just brick and pavement, marble colored benches, and tall slabs of granite. Off to the left she saw a marble- colored swing so she started that way.
 
As she dashed across the park to the swing her left thigh began to ache, a tingling numbness rather than true pain, where nerve endings had been severed in a long slash from her hip to calf by a red wolf with golden eyes;, a female wolf.
 
The scars bothered Amber most when it rained, an annoying reminder of the night she ran away from her son’s father, the night she learned that the monster legend did indeed exist.
